# EXCEL PROJECT: SALES ANALYSIS
This project involves analyzing and visualizing a large Excel dataset containing 8400 rows and 24 columns. The dataset includes information on sales volume, revenue, and other relevant metrics. The goal of the project is to create comprehensive sales reports that can be segmented by various dimensions, such as time, region, and department.

**Tools used:** To achieve this goal, the project will utilize a combination of data analysis and visualization tools, including Power Pivot, Slicer, and Pivot Charts. Power Pivot will be used to create a data model from the raw dataset, enabling efficient data manipulation and aggregation. Slicer will be employed to create interactive filters that allow users to explore the data by selecting specific dimensions. Pivot Charts will be used to generate visually appealing charts and graphs that effectively communicate sales trends and patterns.
